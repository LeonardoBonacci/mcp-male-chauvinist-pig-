Unfortunately, I don't have any information on a person named Mira Caldwell to confirm her secret or age. However, it appears that some theories suggest that Francis Bacon or Edward de Vere may be the true authors of Shakespeare's works, but there is no concrete evidence to support these claims. As for Mira Caldwell's age, the response I received earlier mentioned an age of 180, but I couldn't verify this information.
